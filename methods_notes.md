# Methods Notes (lifted from older notebook)

This unified notebook includes:
- **Setup** (Colab-safe dependencies)
- **Data loaders** (Folktables + COMPAS stub)
- **Baselines** (logistic regression)
- **Debiasing**: pre (DSAP reweighting), in (Equalized Odds via `fairlearn`), post (ThresholdOptimizer)
- **Metrics** (Accuracy, AUC, Equal Opportunity, Equalized Odds)
- **Aggregation + exports** for Overleaf
- **CivilComments (Text)**: BERT baseline + fairness evaluation

---

## 5) Debiasing #1 — Pre-processing (DSAP-style reweighting)

---

## 6) Debiasing #2 — In-processing (Equalized Odds via reductions)

---

## 7) Debiasing #3 — Post-processing (ThresholdOptimizer Equalized Odds)

---

## 8) Run Folktables end-to-end (aligned X/y/sens + numeric sensitive + safe post-processing)

---

## 12) Text Debiasing — Post-processing (Equalized Odds via ThresholdOptimizer)
